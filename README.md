At this checkpoint, you’re instructed to:

. use semantic tags.
. add a video/audio to the web page.
. use local links, lists, or tables.
. use HTML forms.

Here's an example to use as a guideline (keep in mind not to replicate it entirely. Try to be creative.)

Instructions
1- Create the navbar: home, about, work, resume, contact
2- Create the “about” section, ”work” section, ”resume” section, and ”contact” section (using HTML Forms)
3- Create the page footer.
